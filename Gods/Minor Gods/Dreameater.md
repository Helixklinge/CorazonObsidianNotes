A nightmarish godlike creature that feasts on the dreams (nightmares) of mortals

It often latches on to a few specific victims and turns their dreams into nightmares for it to feast on, turning each night into a fight for survival as the being causes them to suffer in the real world for the pain they take in their dreams.
