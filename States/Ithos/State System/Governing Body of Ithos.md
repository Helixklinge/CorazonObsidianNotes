Ithos used to be a union of city state republics, which all used to govern their own cities based upon an elected citizen council which worked together alongside a royal family. However, in the year 168 the controlling Family of the city of Cremona, the Solicians have decided they were not content with only ruling over their city and thus in a war between the city states took over the others, which resulted in the collapse of the union of city states and ended with the Solicians taking over the entire Union. Because of this, Ithos is now directly controlled by its ruling family and every governing decision is either made directly by one of the family members or one of their delegates.
