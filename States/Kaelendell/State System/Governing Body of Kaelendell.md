Kaelendell's Governing Body is the Ruler itself, who grants their possession of the lands to several royal families, who either directly rule over the granted fiefs, such as the lord of Cindralis or once again grant parts or the entirety of their granted lands to other less powerful nobles. This tree like structure has several layers and ends with a large amount of lords and ladies owning small amounts of land. These lords and ladies reign over everyone living on their lands and these areas are usually self-governed, however, the laws have to follow a course set by their superiors who in turn all have to report to the Ruler.
