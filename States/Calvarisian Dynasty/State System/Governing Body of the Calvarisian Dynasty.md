The governing body of the Dynasty used to just be the ruling Family, however, over the few centuries they kept hiring more and more advisors to help out with proper decision making and over time the advisor council took over basically all of the governing decisions. The Dynasty has now become a de-facto aristocracy with the important distinction being that the advisors for their specific area (such as military or economy) are selected based upon election from a specific council for that area, which is comprised of the best of the best the academies for that specific area of government could provide. The dynasty's matriarch by now is only ruler de jure. Officially she has to sign off on all decisions, but it's incredibly rare for her to ever not sign off on a law.
